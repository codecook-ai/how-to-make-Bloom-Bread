1. **Prepare the dough**  
   - In a large bowl, mix together **flour** and **salt** on one side, and **yeast** on the other.  
   - Pour in the **warm water** and **olive oil**.  
   - Stir until the dough starts to come together.

2. **Knead the dough**  
   - Transfer to a lightly floured surface and **knead for 10 minutes** until smooth and elastic.  
   - (Alternatively, knead in a stand mixer for about 7 minutes.)

3. **First rise**  
   - Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl.  
   - Cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap.  
   - Leave to rise for **1 hour**, or until doubled in size.

4. **Shape the bloomer**  
   - Gently tip out the dough onto a floured surface and knock out the air.  
   - Flatten it into a rectangle, then roll it tightly into an oval loaf shape.  
   - Place it seam-side down on a floured baking tray or parchment paper.

5. **Second rise**  
   - Cover loosely with a towel and let it rise again for **30–40 minutes**, until puffy.

6. **Prepare for baking**  
   - Preheat your oven to **220°C (425°F)**.  
   - Lightly brush the loaf with **olive oil** or water.  
   - Using a sharp knife, make **5–7 diagonal slashes** across the top (about 1 cm deep).

7. **Bake the bread**  
   - Place a small tray of hot water in the bottom of the oven to create steam.  
   - Bake for **25–30 minutes**, until golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.

   - Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely before slicing.  
   - Enjoy fresh, toasted, or as the base for sandwiches.
